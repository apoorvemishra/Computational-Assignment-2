 GSL functions for solving initial value problems.

1. **`gsl_odeiv2_step_rkf45`**
   - Algorithm: Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method of order (4, 5)
   - API: const gsl_odeiv2_step_type * gsl_odeiv2_step_rkf45;
   - Description: This function provides an adaptive step-size Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method for solving ODEs. It's a good choice when the error tolerance needs to be controlled dynamically.

2. **`gsl_odeiv2_step_rk4imp`**
   - Algorithm: Implicit Runge-Kutta method of order 4
   - API: const gsl_odeiv2_step_type * gsl_odeiv2_step_rk4imp;
   - Description: This function implements an implicit Runge-Kutta method of order 4. Implicit methods are useful for stiff ODEs, where the stiffness requires a smaller step size for stability.

3. **`gsl_odeiv2_step_msadams`**
   - Algorithm: Multi-step Adams method
   - API: const gsl_odeiv2_step_type * gsl_odeiv2_step_msadams;
   - Description: This function implements a multi-step Adams method for solving ODEs. It's efficient for non-stiff problems where high accuracy is desired, and the step size can be kept relatively large.

These functions are part of the GSL ODEIV (Ordinary Differential Equation Initial Value) module and provide robust numerical methods for solving various types of ODEs.
