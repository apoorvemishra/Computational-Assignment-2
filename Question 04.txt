Stiff differential equations are a type of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) where the solution changes rapidly in some directions of the solution space and slowly in others.
These equations typically involve multiple time scales, leading to numerical instability when solved using standard methods.

A physical process often described by stiff differential equations is chemical kinetics, especially when there are reactions occurring at very different rates.
For example, chemical reactions involving combustion, atmospheric chemistry, or enzyme kinetics can lead to stiff systems of ODEs due to the presence of both fast and slow reactions.

When solving stiff differential equations, implicit methods are often preferred over explicit methods because they are more stable and can handle the stiffness more effectively.
Among the implicit methods, the implicit Runge-Kutta methods and BDF (Backward Differentiation Formula) methods are commonly used for stiff ODEs.

For solving stiff differential equations in Python using NumPy, you can use the solve_ivp function from the SciPy library.
This function allows you to solve initial value problems (IVPs) for stiff ODEs efficiently.
When using solve_ivp, you can specify the solver method using the method parameter.
For stiff problems, the 'BDF' (Backward Differentiation Formula) method is a good choice.
